        Whales are kinda big. Like at least bigger than a potato or something. The blue whale can grow to 90 
        or more feet, and weight over 330,000 pounds. So if you're a sumo wrestler, might wanna eat a little 
        more before tussle with moby dick. Bowhead wales can actually live more than 200 years, thats alot of 
        call of dutys that will come out. Homie be swimming crazy too, like more than 6200 miles from feeding 
        grounds to breeding grounds. Could not be me. They also help reduce climate change with their poop. I 
        probably should verify these websites huh.
