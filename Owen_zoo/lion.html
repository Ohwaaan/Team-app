    <p>The average male lion weighs 190kg or around 418 pounds. To help visualize this would be roughly 
        40 average three-month old babies on top of each other. They can also eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal.
        Their tongues actualy help quite a bit as they have sharp pointy rasps, called papillae that scrape meat off 
        the bones. They also hunt even if there is a storm, as the noise and wind makes it more difficult for their 
        prey to notice them.
