    <p>Eagles are some of the largest birds and on top of thier food chain, some species 
        even hunting on monkeys and sloths. Like penguins, eagles also are monogamous, meaning 
        they mate for life, unless thier partner dies early or does not return to the nest 
        for a year or so. Thier vision is also 4-5 times better than that of a human, so they 
        probably don't need glasses. Speaking of eagles flying mad fast, they fly mad fast, 
        from 75 to 99 miles per hour. In comparison the fastest a person has even ran is 27 and 
        a half miles per hour. So, probably don't race one, 
    </p>
