    <p>The red panda, also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail. The red panda is largely herbivorous and feeds primarily on bamboo. It also feeds on fruits, blossoms, acorns, eggs, birds and small mammals. It mainly eats the leaves of bamboo, which are often the only available food item in the winter and the most common food for the rest of the year.
