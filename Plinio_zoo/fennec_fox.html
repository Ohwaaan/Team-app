    <p>The fennec fox is native to North African deserts.  It inhabits small sand dunes and vast treeless sand areas with sparse vegetation such as grasses, sedges and small shrubs. It is an omnivore feeding mostly on small rodents, lizards, geckos, skinks, small birds and their eggs, and fruits. The fennec is the smallest species of fox. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to the desert environment with high temperatures and little water.
