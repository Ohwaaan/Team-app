      <br>
      Silverback doesnâ€™t refer to a particular species of gorillas but a mature male gorilla. Silverback gorillas are distinguished by a grayish white hairline around the back and shoulders. A fully grown silverback gorilla is about twice the weight of an adult man. They are over 9 times stronger than an adult male. Silverback gorillas in general eat mainly plants, consisting of fruits, shoots and leaves
