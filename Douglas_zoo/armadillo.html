  <p> Animal Info:
      <br>
      Armadillos have pointy snouts and long, sticky tongues, similar to anteaters, which are close cousins. 
      Their eyesight is poor, so they hunt with a highly developed sense of smell. An armadillo's armor is made up of overlapping plates covering the back, head, legs and tail. 
      The number of armored bands identifies the different species, like the three-banded armadillo can roll itself into a hard armored ball to defend itself against predators.
