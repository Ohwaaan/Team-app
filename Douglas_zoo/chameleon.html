  <p> Animal Info:
      <br>
      Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder. These colorful lizards are known as one of the few animals that can change skin color. However, it is a misconception that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings. Rather, they change skin color in response to emotions or to attract other chameleons.
