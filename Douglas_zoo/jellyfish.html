  <p> Animal Info:
      <br>
      The box jellyfish itself grows up to 15 tentacles that can reach up to 3m in length. Along each of the tentacles lies about 5,000 stinging cells that are triggered by chemicals on the skin of animals or humans. Their venom is designed to either instantly stun or kill their prey, and this prevents damage to their delicate tentacles. Box jellyfishes steer through water and move up to six metres per minute.
